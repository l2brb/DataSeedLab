To this aim we have developed BES TEST (Bone Elastic Structure TEST), a test for assessing the elasticity (quality) of the bone internal structure. BES TEST is useful for diagnosing, monitoring and preventing the bone alterations that cause fragility. M2TEST was founded in Trieste on 6 October 2016 by Francesca Cosmi and Alessandra Nicolosi, following the victory in 2016 of the Challenge lauched by Innovation Factory, the certified incubator of AREA Science Park, which is now a partner in M2TEST. Paying particular attention to specialization and innovation, M2TEST aims to improve life by providing a unique solution, easy to implement and not invasive, which can monitor the real risk of bone fracture, helping the physician in keeping the disease under control and satisfying the growing demand for greater efficiency, constant quality and safety in the diagnosis of fracture risk. BES TEST is based on the simulation of the application of forces on a virtual biopsy of the patient's bone architecture, obtained from low-dose radiographic images. It was developed over a period of 15 years as part of the research activities carried out at the University of Trieste by Francesca Cosmi, professor of Mechanical Engineering. Starting from the engineering models used to simulate the behavior of structures, Francesca over the years developed and defined an analysis process that allows to determine the structural quality of the bone through simulations of the elastic behavior of its internal structure, detected by a plane radiographic image. The method used by BES TEST is covered by an American patent whose sole author is ̀Francesca Cosmi (co-founder and majority shareholder) and an Italian patent. Additional innovative aspects related to M2TEST's core business have recently been deposited in the USA and extended by PCT.  BES TEST is considered a software medical device, registered by the Italian Ministry of Health, and has already obtained the CE mark and the ISO 13485 qualification. To date, M2TEST collaborates with 16 early adopter and several hospital in Italy, both private medical practices and multi-specialized centers.

It is a tool that allows every executive and operations manager to check, at a glance, the results of online sales in relation to the expected objectives for the period.  It can be installed and configured in just a few minutes without the need for any specific technical skills. Thanks to intuitive dashboards, it shows in real-time the results of visits and sales that the online shop is producing. In addition, with special indicators, you can see at a glance whether performance is good or bad. Slymetrix Analytics also offers the possibility of displaying dashboards in 16:9 so that they can be transmitted live on a TV monitor: if placed in your office, it allows you to quickly check the real-time performance throughout the day. In addition, the advanced versions allow the definition of advertising campaigns in the various digital media channels, building an inventory of channels organized by traffic providers. Once the definition is complete, for each channel of each campaign the platform generates a tracking url, through which it will be possible to monitor the performance of the campaigns and those of the digital media channels.  In conclusion, with Slymetrix Analytics every e-commerce retailer can boost its performance by optimizing its media investment by monitoring results according to budget forecasts. Why investing: Because Slymetrix is the key tool to enable e-commerce to improve its performance and thus achieve the expected economic goals (increase sales and profit by at least 30%). The e-commerce market is growing steadily and today has around 15 million online shops.  Because we have developed a 100% scalable Full SaaS business model, cloning successful international models with the intention of attracting the attention of large international groups interested in acquiring the startup (exit).  Because our goal is to achieve an exit within 3/5 years of incorporation that will allow investors in this round to get x10 return.  Market: Slymetrix is positioned in the Business Analytics Software Platforms market. The global Business Analytics Software market size was valued at $53.68 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $120.27 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 10.5% from 2020 to 2027.

If we were able to retransform it completely, we would no longer waste the raw materials that make them up. It would no longer be waste but a valuable mine of resources, which we could reuse indefinitely. If, instead of getting rid of waste, we were able to regenerate 100% of it, only considering, for example, metals, glass and plastic, we would save the planet 21% of our environmental impact and ensure the sustainability of the supply of precious raw materials over time. The solution is to sustainably recover raw materials, i.e. transform our waste into raw materials upstream of the supply chain, where we generate it. Grycle is a patented technology that transforms undifferentiated waste into flakes of raw materials, automatically separated and ready for industrial reuse. The machine eliminates the need for manual sorting, reduces the volume of waste by more than 90% and tra nsforms it into second raw material that can be reused in industrial transformation processes.  Grycle is equipped with an artificial intelligence module that allows it to progressively learn to recognize new materials. Depending on the capacity of its sensors, Grycle can be trained to recognize new materials, in self-learning mode, even composite materials. When one machine will recognize a new material, all the others will automatically acquire the same ability. When Grycle is powered by photovoltaics, the machine is completely self-sufficient and can be installed anywhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Software",4,"Daniele Pes, Edoardo Carlucci, Stefania Iacono Pezzillo, Tiziano Vicentini",1-10,2,Seed,2020-02-07,332000,EUR,363390,Seed,332000,EUR,363390,Seed,382000,EUR,419135,382000,EUR,419135,Corner Stones,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,-0.4,1,2,1,Separation Of Solid Materials Using Liquids Or Using Pneumatic Tables Or Jigs,Machines and machine tools

EMOJ offers HW and SW solutions able to analyze emotions in real time, map them to the Customer Journey and translate them into a digital experience that emotionally connect people with the sensing space where they move. Most of today sensing and interactive environments are provided with cognitive intelligence but not with emotional one. What would happen if a music sounds or the light turns on or a digital content on our smartphone based on our felt emotions? Finally, we could live in a world of shared emotions and in a space of real social interaction. The main goal of EMOJ is to make the experience of visiting a place and shopping so pleasant, engaging, funny and emotional to leave a vivid memory of it and push coming back and repurchasing. In this context, EMOJ proposes advanced technologies of Emotional Data Analytics and Intelligence able to capture and understand costumers’ emotions and behaviors and react in real time with tailored services and interactive spaces. EMOJ customers can finally know their consumers, investigate their shopping preferences and attitudes, and understand the motivations for their actions and decision-making. EMOJ also proposes technologies to cocreate an interactive and sensing space per what the consumer feels and does. All solutions aim to increase the degree of consumer’s satisfaction and loyalty. It operates in several markets, from Smart Retail to Travel & Hospitality, till Museums.  EMOJ is the winner of the Italian Awards TILT, ECAPITAL and IOT AWARD for 2017. EMOJ exploits recent results in the fields of Deep Learning, 3D vision and Video Analysis to propose two main product line: - EMOTRACK, that is a software platform for Proximity Emotion Tracking and Big Data Analytics to capture and understand customers’ emotions and behavors through the nstallation of RGB-D and 4K Pro video cameras, optical sensors and microphones. - ETrack that is a software development toolkit (SDK) and cloud-based APIs to detect emotions and eye fixation on web pagines and mobile applications and respond to user's emotions in real time by creating adaptive contents, advertisements, events. It adds emotion awarness to apps, games and other products. - REACTION toolkit able to activate and control a set of connected devices for the creation of an interactive space and/or for the supply of tailored services based on the analyzed Big Data. The aim of the Reaction Toolkit is to create a pleasant, involving and engaging experience of the store and increase the customer’s satisfaction. The reactions regard changes and adaptations of the space where the customer is moving such as the color of lights, the sound tracks, environmental perfumes and the application of video mapping techniques on the floor, ceiling and walls. At the same time the data can be elaborated to send to the customer coupons, offerings, prized via sms or via app notifications. The EMOBOX project is part of the EMOTRACK line, focusing on the development of a unique and standalone box to monitor both Customer Behaviour, Eye Fixation and Emotion in an integral and synchrounous way. The Box and its analytics dashboard are able to provide a complete description of the Customer Journey Map to support the design of successful Shopping Experience clues and the creation of adaptive reaction of the sensible store. The box contains a RGB-4k camera, an optical sensor, a microphone, a wi-fi router and a microprocessor. The dashboard displays clusterized statistical data about the behavior tracks, the emotional curve and areas of observation and gives a synthetic visualization of the Customer Journey in the store. The output is a map of the Customer Journey, a detail of the Heatmap (areas of most eye fixation) and an Emotional Curve for each touchpoint. The base for the statistical elaboration of the achieved Big Data is an Emotional Analyzer, a Behaviour Analyzer and a module for Motion and Fixation Detection. The advantages to apply EMOJ solutions are several: to improve the attention at driving in case the system detects boredom or distraction, to automate video surveillance by increasing the safety operators’ effectiveness, to improve the comfort and ergonomics of workbenches if the system detects wrong postures or iterate movements, to increase the level of satisfaction and appreciation of the shopping experience, to adapt digital contents for video games, e-commerce platforms, store windows according to the captured sex, age emotion, area of observation and position of the customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1.9,4,1,0,Computing; Calculating,
