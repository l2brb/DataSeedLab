ToothPic’s mission is turning every smartphone into a secure and user-friendly key for user authentication. ToothPic is an official university spin-off of Politecnico di Torino, a major engineering school in Italy and Europe, and is incubated in the university incubator I3P, recently recognized by UBI Global as the best public incubator worldwide.  ToothPic was founded by a team of 4 researchers and professors from Politecnico di Torino, and in 2018 received a seed from VV3TT, an Italian Venture Capital fund dedicated to Technology Transfer from public research. ToothPic technology is protected by 4 patents, and won several prizes in competitions dedicated to startups and twice the Seal of Excellence issued by the European Commission.  ToothPic’s target is the market of authentication systems. Its technology recognizes the unique pattern of invisible imperfections that characterize smartphone cameras to protect cryptographic keys stored on devices, that are commonly used for user authentication, digital signature, blockchain related applications. The additional layer of security represented by this random unclonable feature can be obtained with no additional hardware and related costs.  A Software Development Kit has been developed for Android and iOS. It can be integrated into existing third-party apps and authentication systems, allowing the device possession verification by (de)obfuscating asymmetric cryptographic keys. Users’ credentials are not stored in a centralized service provider server - representing a single point of failure exploitable by an attacker, but they are distributed on users’ devices. Hence, an adversary willing to violate those credentials should target each single user device, facilitating for service providers the migration from an on premises architecture to the cloud, because they don’t need to manage sensitive users credentials, but only their public key.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1.0,Giulio Coluccia,1-10,2.0,Seed,2021-01-19,810000.0,EUR,983306.0,Seed,810000.0,EUR,983306.0,Seed,1110000.0,EUR,1349588.0,1110000.0,EUR,1349588.0,"Club degli Investitori, Vertis Venture 3 Tech Transfer",,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,2.9,0.0,,3.0,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,

Every 7 seconds around the world a person suffers of Acute Brain Damage because of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). They are the most costly and prevalent killers in the last 15 years (15 million deaths by CVD in 2015), and the leading cause of disability (the global incidence rate of TBI is 200 per 100k people per year). WHO estimated a global expenditure of $ 330 billion in 2015, but it is going to increase sharply: $ 4 trillion in 2025 - including premature death, disability, and health care costs - just for CVD in LMICs.  Temperature is a vital body parameter. It regulates all cellular functions so its management is essential for the good outcome of patients in several medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuro and cardiac surgery, epilepsy, migraine and oncology. Regulating body temperature at a desired level makes all other treatments more effective. The most modern medical approach is the target temperature management, where physicians try to maintain the most favourable temperature for the patient for up to 24-36 hours, preventing excessive warming (fever) or cooling. Our device is a targeted temperature management system composed by a THERAPEUTIC COLLAR POWERED BY A SMART CONTROL UNIT (the size of a small briefcase). The collar transforms the neck into a natural heat exchanger exploiting several physiological and anatomical characteristics of the human body. It is quicker to act on brain tissue but can also function as total body temperature adjusting device if required. A disposable protective shield makes cleaning the collar after each use simple while featuring an optimal safety profile both in term of pathogens and allergens. The control unit collects all the data of the treatment and transmits them to the Emergency Response System.  Our mission is to improve the safety of patients on the roadside, at home or in the workplace, and to reduce the costs of chronic care. In fact, Neuron Guard aims to be the only device that can be used in every circumstance, inside and outside the hospital, and allow the user to fully manage the temperature of the patient warming and cooling as necessary.  Our vision is to have a Neuron Guard kit in every public place just like the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to empower bystanders to immediately react in case of emergency. Under this perspective our device becomes a connected-intelligent platform that takes care of the patient, connects the scene with the Emergency Response System transmitting vital data to improve the readiness and effectiveness of professional intervention. The device is patented in Italy, USA and China. We have made several prototypes in collaboration with Italian and English companies, such as Tecno Elettra Impianti and TWI, tested it in laboratory and published the experimental results on the NeuroCritical Care Journal. We have also conducted a GAP Analysis with another English consulting firm (CDP) and we are testing the human prototype internally.  We are seeking to raise 2.5M€ to complete the pre-industrialization, with design and construction of the human device for the pilot trial, finalized the regulatory clearance and launch it into the market in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2.0,"Enrico Giuliani, Mary Franzese",1-10,3.0,Seed,2021-11-05,650000.0,EUR,750848.0,Debt Financing,550000.0,EUR,635333.0,Seed,1206000.0,EUR,1350971.0,1856000.0,EUR,2101819.0,"CDP Venture Capital, Fondo Rilancio Startup, A11 Venture",2.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,1.9,6.0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,3.0,Medical apparatus and instruments,

The e-commerce dropoutmilano.com has seen millions of visitors and thousands of sales, guaranteeing authenticity of all products shipped and providing free delivery across EU. To support the business activities, dropout's team have developed a software of technical analysis for the secondary streetwear market, named HypeAnalyzer.

Output of these also include data for consignment rates (dynamic and affected by things such as volatility and demand, objectively calculated) and discounts. dropout is looking to scale this, simple yet efficient, model, for many other things retail and e-commerce and is currently studying the creation of a portal for investment in sneakers as alternative assets. HypeAnalyzer is covered by commercial patent in Italy (SIAE, D000014993) and dropout® is trademarked at continental level.

To this aim we have developed BES TEST (Bone Elastic Structure TEST), a test for assessing the elasticity (quality) of the bone internal structure. BES TEST is useful for diagnosing, monitoring and preventing the bone alterations that cause fragility. M2TEST was founded in Trieste on 6 October 2016 by Francesca Cosmi and Alessandra Nicolosi, following the victory in 2016 of the Challenge lauched by Innovation Factory, the certified incubator of AREA Science Park, which is now a partner in M2TEST. Paying particular attention to specialization and innovation, M2TEST aims to improve life by providing a unique solution, easy to implement and not invasive, which can monitor the real risk of bone fracture, helping the physician in keeping the disease under control and satisfying the growing demand for greater efficiency, constant quality and safety in the diagnosis of fracture risk. BES TEST is based on the simulation of the application of forces on a virtual biopsy of the patient's bone architecture, obtained from low-dose radiographic images. It was developed over a period of 15 years as part of the research activities carried out at the University of Trieste by Francesca Cosmi, professor of Mechanical Engineering. Starting from the engineering models used to simulate the behavior of structures, Francesca over the years developed and defined an analysis process that allows to determine the structural quality of the bone through simulations of the elastic behavior of its internal structure, detected by a plane radiographic image. The method used by BES TEST is covered by an American patent whose sole author is ̀Francesca Cosmi (co-founder and majority shareholder) and an Italian patent.

It is a tool that allows every executive and operations manager to check, at a glance, the results of online sales in relation to the expected objectives for the period.  It can be installed and configured in just a few minutes without the need for any specific technical skills. Thanks to intuitive dashboards, it shows in real-time the results of visits and sales that the online shop is producing. In addition, with special indicators, you can see at a glance whether performance is good or bad. Slymetrix Analytics also offers the possibility of displaying dashboards in 16:9 so that they can be transmitted live on a TV monitor: if placed in your office, it allows you to quickly check the real-time performance throughout the day. In addition, the advanced versions allow the definition of advertising campaigns in the various digital media channels, building an inventory of channels organized by traffic providers. Once the definition is complete, for each channel of each campaign the platform generates a tracking url, through which it will be possible to monitor the performance of the campaigns and those of the digital media channels.  In conclusion, with Slymetrix Analytics every e-commerce retailer can boost its performance by optimizing its media investment by monitoring results according to budget forecasts. Why investing: Because Slymetrix is the key tool to enable e-commerce to improve its performance and thus achieve the expected economic goals (increase sales and profit by at least 30%). The e-commerce market is growing steadily and today has around 15 million online shops.  Because we have developed a 100% scalable Full SaaS business model, cloning successful international models with the intention of attracting the attention of large international groups interested in acquiring the startup (exit).  Because our goal is to achieve an exit within 3/5 years of incorporation that will allow investors in this round to get x10 return.  Market: Slymetrix is positioned in the Business Analytics Software Platforms market. The global Business Analytics Software market size was valued at $53.68 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $120.27 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 10.5% from 2020 to 2027. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: We have laid the foundations for evolving our mathematical algorithms into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence systems that will make decisions on behalf of platform users.

If we were able to retransform it completely, we would no longer waste the raw materials that make them up. It would no longer be waste but a valuable mine of resources, which we could reuse indefinitely. If, instead of getting rid of waste, we were able to regenerate 100% of it, only considering, for example, metals, glass and plastic, we would save the planet 21% of our environmental impact and ensure the sustainability of the supply of precious raw materials over time. The solution is to sustainably recover raw materials, i.e. transform our waste into raw materials upstream of the supply chain, where we generate it. Grycle is a patented technology that transforms undifferentiated waste into flakes of raw materials, automatically separated and ready for industrial reuse. The machine eliminates the need for manual sorting, reduces the volume of waste by more than 90% and tra nsforms it into second raw material that can be reused in industrial transformation processes.  Grycle is equipped with an artificial intelligence module that allows it to progressively learn to recognize new materials. Depending on the capacity of its sensors, Grycle can be trained to recognize new materials, in self-learning mode, even composite materials. When one machine will recognize a new material, all the others will automatically acquire the same ability.

EMOJ offers HW and SW solutions able to analyze emotions in real time, map them to the Customer Journey and translate them into a digital experience that emotionally connect people with the sensing space where they move. Most of today sensing and interactive environments are provided with cognitive intelligence but not with emotional one. What would happen if a music sounds or the light turns on or a digital content on our smartphone based on our felt emotions? Finally, we could live in a world of shared emotions and in a space of real social interaction. The main goal of EMOJ is to make the experience of visiting a place and shopping so pleasant, engaging, funny and emotional to leave a vivid memory of it and push coming back and repurchasing. In this context, EMOJ proposes advanced technologies of Emotional Data Analytics and Intelligence able to capture and understand costumers’ emotions and behaviors and react in real time with tailored services and interactive spaces. EMOJ customers can finally know their consumers, investigate their shopping preferences and attitudes, and understand the motivations for their actions and decision-making. EMOJ also proposes technologies to cocreate an interactive and sensing space per what the consumer feels and does. All solutions aim to increase the degree of consumer’s satisfaction and loyalty. It operates in several markets, from Smart Retail to Travel & Hospitality, till Museums.  EMOJ is the winner of the Italian Awards TILT, ECAPITAL and IOT AWARD for 2017. EMOJ exploits recent results in the fields of Deep Learning, 3D vision and Video Analysis to propose two main product line: - EMOTRACK, that is a software platform for Proximity Emotion Tracking and Big Data Analytics to capture and understand customers’ emotions and behavors through the nstallation of RGB-D and 4K Pro video cameras, optical sensors and microphones. - ETrack that is a software development toolkit (SDK) and cloud-based APIs to detect emotions and eye fixation on web pagines and mobile applications and respond to user's emotions in real time by creating adaptive contents, advertisements, events. It adds emotion awarness to apps, games and other products. - REACTION toolkit able to activate and control a set of connected devices for the creation of an interactive space and/or for the supply of tailored services based on the analyzed Big Data. The aim of the Reaction Toolkit is to create a pleasant, involving and engaging experience of the store and increase the customer’s satisfaction. The reactions regard changes and adaptations of the space where the customer is moving such as the color of lights, the sound tracks, environmental perfumes and the application of video mapping techniques on the floor, ceiling and walls. At the same time the data can be elaborated to send to the customer coupons, offerings, prized via sms or via app notifications. The EMOBOX project is part of the EMOTRACK line, focusing on the development of a unique and standalone box to monitor both Customer Behaviour, Eye Fixation and Emotion in an integral and synchrounous way. The Box and its analytics dashboard are able to provide a complete description of the Customer Journey Map to support the design of successful Shopping Experience clues and the creation of adaptive reaction of the sensible store. The box contains a RGB-4k camera, an optical sensor, a microphone, a wi-fi router and a microprocessor. The dashboard displays clusterized statistical data about the behavior tracks, the emotional curve and areas of observation and gives a synthetic visualization of the Customer Journey in the store. The output is a map of the Customer Journey, a detail of the Heatmap (areas of most eye fixation) and an Emotional Curve for each touchpoint. The base for the statistical elaboration of the achieved Big Data is an Emotional Analyzer, a Behaviour Analyzer and a module for Motion and Fixation Detection. The advantages to apply EMOJ solutions are several: to improve the attention at driving in case the system detects boredom or distraction, to automate video surveillance by increasing the safety operators’ effectiveness, to improve the comfort and ergonomics of workbenches if the system detects wrong postures or iterate movements, to increase the level of satisfaction and appreciation of the shopping experience, to adapt digital contents for video games, e-commerce platforms, store windows according to the captured sex, age emotion, area of observation and position of the customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,-1.9,1.0,Computing; Calculating,0.0,,

This late detection leads to higher intervention costs, greater emotional distress for children, and increased strain on teachers and families. DINO is revolutionizing the way we approach early learning disorder identification by leveraging AI, gamification, and data-driven insights to create a scalable, efficient, and engaging solution for schools. Our mission is simple: ensure that every child, regardless of background or geography, has access to early and accurate learning disorder detection. By intervening at the right time, we empower schools, educators, and families to provide the best possible support for students who need it most. A Disruptive Approach to Educational Assessment Traditional methods of identifying learning difficulties are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and dependent on expert evaluations that may not be readily available. DINO changes this paradigm by offering: AI-powered early detection – Our intelligent algorithms analyze gameplay data to identify potential learning challenges in real time. Gamified assessment – Students engage in fun, interactive activities that collect meaningful cognitive and linguistic data without creating stress or pressure. Minimal teacher intervention – The tool is designed for independent use, allowing educators to focus on classroom instruction while gathering valuable insights. Scalability and cost-efficiency – Unlike traditional assessment methods, DINO can be deployed in multiple schools with minimal logistical constraints. Proven Business Model & Strong Market Validation DINO’s business model has been successfully implemented in Italy, demonstrating strong financial sustainability and market demand. Our approach is based on: A subscription-based pricing model: Schools pay a setup fee (€200 per institution) and an annual fee per student (€10 per child), ensuring affordability while maintaining profitability.

Founded in 2015, it aims to contribute to the construction of a safer and more sustainable Food system. Wenda is the only all-in-one collaborative Platform to govern Food traceability data from the cold and hot chain. Wenda is a collaborative Platform that automatically collects, analyzes and shares supply chain data, automatically integrating with existing measurement tools, data loggers and management, logistics and quality software available on the market and already in use in the customer company. In this way it provides decision support and statistics on temperature and traceability to each player in each specific supply chain. Wenda’s multi-disciplinary team has a long experience in technology, in the management of corporate clients and in agile innovation methods (IoT solutions). It has developed key partnerships with Universities and leading European companies. Wenda mission is to contribute to the reduction of the Food waste by leveraging on the power of digitalization of the Food supply chain. At the same time, the company aims to contribute to the development of safety and traceability in the food system. Wenda developed an user-friendly, ease-to use and versatile Platform which automatically collects, controls, manages and shares food distribution supply chain data, integrating with measurement tools, data loggers and software (management, logistics and quality). The Platform responds to the food distribution companies needs for reduction of time and costs for the optimization of their processes and necessity of control of risk points. Wenda products can be widespread at a global level. The innovativeness of its technology, international vocation and its scalable business model make its solution the best one in allowing to effectively pursue its mission. Below is a list of the different features of the Platform. -Data management and integrity analytics: You can gain visibility into traceability and temperature data by controlling the main risk points in the supply chain. With the simple and easy-to-use all-in- one Platform, you can enhance your decision making and service level, cutting costs, optimizing time and increasing profits. -Document digitization and data storage: you can import the documents of each shipment, storage or goods entry, reducing storage time, quickly retrieving information and documents, receiving alerts and operational actions, sharing data with employees. All this from a single integrated and easy to use Platform. -Universal IoT Platform: The full potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be exploited to integrate all data loggers and measuring instruments already in use in the customer company or available on the market and to make them communicate with each other. In this way you can save time and ensure continuity with the technologies already in use, welcoming future developments. -Horizontal process management: You can increase your supply chain collaboration by working across the company and strengthening your connection with customers and suppliers. Thanks to multi-site management and multi-access control, you can choose with whom to share data in real time, allowing access to logistics, quality and management departments. This data can also be shared directly with suppliers and customers. -Blockchain, Big Data and Machine learning: the use of blockchain has three major benefits: transparency (everyone can visualize the information recorded on the blockchain), decentralization (blockchain operates on a network), security (data and transactions on the blockchain are encrypted). All the data gathered in the Platform form a huge quantity of data (Big Data): this improve the quality of decisions operators can make on the basis of that data, An additional help comes from the Machine Learning algorithm integrated in the Platform: the machine “learns” the best and most efficient way to manage processes and builds more and more refined models which can help operators in making decisions. A key goal of the Platform is to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. This is why the Platform is organized into modules, allowing the customer to choose the ones needed for operations: taken individually, the modules manage temperature and heat and cold chain traceability in well-defined supply chain processes; when used in combination, the modules provide full end-to-end visibility of supply chain processes, supporting key players in making effective decisions, rationalizing costs, increasing profits and enhancing service levels. Below is a review of the different modules of the Platform: Shipping Phase - SHIPMENT Module Control, manage and share cold and heat chain data and traceability of products shipped in direct or split trucks, full containers (FCL) or groupage (LCL). Share information with customers and employees through the Shipment Module. -Control and management from web app -Verification of the condition of goods in transit -Logistic performance control -Savings from delivery optimization -Integrated data loggers: real-time datalogger / USB datalogger, Sea freight, Ground freight, Air freight, location, temperature, humidity and other sensors Storage phase - STORAGE Module Control, manage and share temperature data and traceability of old generation cold rooms, refrigerated display cabinets, manholes or refrigerators or already controlled with telemetry, and provide information to employees with the Storage Module. -Control and management from web app and mobile app -Digitizing the control of stored products -Verification of refrigeration systems -Save time on HACCP checks and reports -Integrated data loggers: wi-fi real-time data loggers / Bluetooth probes or data loggers / other instruments already in use in the company Reception stage - INBOUND Module Verify the product for which you will be responsible by checking, managing and sharing the temperature data and HACCP checklists detected during the goods entry.

Nanomnia produces organic, biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticles, for encapsulation of active compounds, such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, to be selectively vehicled in plants. Nanoparticles increase the efficiency of crop treatments, further reducing their volatilization and decreasing toxicity and environmental contamination in crops. Nanoparticles are developed by Nanomnia with different biodegradable and biocompatible polymers that do not cause any type of environmental contamination, and are stable during their storage. Thus agri-nanotechnology holds the promise of controlled release of agrochemicals and site targeted delivery of various macromolecules needed for improved plant resistance to disease, efﬁcient nutrient utilization and enhanced plant growth.
