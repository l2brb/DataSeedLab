ToothPic’s mission is turning every smartphone into a secure and user-friendly key for user authentication. ToothPic is an official university spin-off of Politecnico di Torino, a major engineering school in Italy and Europe, and is incubated in the university incubator I3P, recently recognized by UBI Global as the best public incubator worldwide.  ToothPic was founded by a team of 4 researchers and professors from Politecnico di Torino, and in 2018 received a seed from VV3TT, an Italian Venture Capital fund dedicated to Technology Transfer from public research. ToothPic technology is protected by 4 patents, and won several prizes in competitions dedicated to startups and twice the Seal of Excellence issued by the European Commission.  ToothPic’s target is the market of authentication systems. Its technology recognizes the unique pattern of invisible imperfections that characterize smartphone cameras to protect cryptographic keys stored on devices, that are commonly used for user authentication, digital signature, blockchain related applications. The additional layer of security represented by this random unclonable feature can be obtained with no additional hardware and related costs.  A Software Development Kit has been developed for Android and iOS. It can be integrated into existing third-party apps and authentication systems, allowing the device possession verification by (de)obfuscating asymmetric cryptographic keys. Users’ credentials are not stored in a centralized service provider server - representing a single point of failure exploitable by an attacker, but they are distributed on users’ devices. Hence, an adversary willing to violate those credentials should target each single user device, facilitating for service providers the migration from an on premises architecture to the cloud, because they don’t need to manage sensitive users credentials, but only their public key.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Giulio Coluccia,1-10,2,Seed,2021-01-19,810000,EUR,983306,Seed,810000,EUR,983306,Seed,1110000,EUR,1349588,1110000,EUR,1349588,"Club degli Investitori, Vertis Venture 3 Tech Transfer",,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,2.9,0,,3,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments

Every 7 seconds around the world a person suffers of Acute Brain Damage because of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). They are the most costly and prevalent killers in the last 15 years (15 million deaths by CVD in 2015), and the leading cause of disability (the global incidence rate of TBI is 200 per 100k people per year). WHO estimated a global expenditure of $ 330 billion in 2015, but it is going to increase sharply: $ 4 trillion in 2025 - including premature death, disability, and health care costs - just for CVD in LMICs.  Temperature is a vital body parameter. It regulates all cellular functions so its management is essential for the good outcome of patients in several medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuro and cardiac surgery, epilepsy, migraine and oncology. Regulating body temperature at a desired level makes all other treatments more effective. The most modern medical approach is the target temperature management, where physicians try to maintain the most favourable temperature for the patient for up to 24-36 hours, preventing excessive warming (fever) or cooling. Our device is a targeted temperature management system composed by a THERAPEUTIC COLLAR POWERED BY A SMART CONTROL UNIT (the size of a small briefcase). The collar transforms the neck into a natural heat exchanger exploiting several physiological and anatomical characteristics of the human body. It is quicker to act on brain tissue but can also function as total body temperature adjusting device if required. A disposable protective shield makes cleaning the collar after each use simple while featuring an optimal safety profile both in term of pathogens and allergens. The control unit collects all the data of the treatment and transmits them to the Emergency Response System.  Our mission is to improve the safety of patients on the roadside, at home or in the workplace, and to reduce the costs of chronic care. In fact, Neuron Guard aims to be the only device that can be used in every circumstance, inside and outside the hospital, and allow the user to fully manage the temperature of the patient warming and cooling as necessary.  Our vision is to have a Neuron Guard kit in every public place just like the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to empower bystanders to immediately react in case of emergency. Under this perspective our device becomes a connected-intelligent platform that takes care of the patient, connects the scene with the Emergency Response System transmitting vital data to improve the readiness and effectiveness of professional intervention. The device is patented in Italy, USA and China. We have made several prototypes in collaboration with Italian and English companies, such as Tecno Elettra Impianti and TWI, tested it in laboratory and published the experimental results on the NeuroCritical Care Journal. We have also conducted a GAP Analysis with another English consulting firm (CDP) and we are testing the human prototype internally.  We are seeking to raise 2.5M€ to complete the pre-industrialization, with design and construction of the human device for the pilot trial, finalized the regulatory clearance and launch it into the market in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Enrico Giuliani, Mary Franzese",1-10,3,Seed,2021-11-05,650000,EUR,750848,Debt Financing,550000,EUR,635333,Seed,1206000,EUR,1350971,1856000,EUR,2101819,"CDP Venture Capital, Fondo Rilancio Startup, A11 Venture",2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,1.9,6,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,3,Medical apparatus and instruments

Snap a picture of your electronics, valuables, apparel or other belongings, get an instant appraisal through our real time valuation engine, and receive a direct payout to your bank account immediately. We are a deep technology company, envisioning a world where products’ lifecycle is lengthened and the ecological burden of trashing minimised.  What exists currently is falling short of the experience modern consumers expect. They value convenience, comfort and speed, and don’t deem existing selling channels even marginally satisfactory. They are tired of the tedious paper-work, negotiating with uncommitted buyers through outdated messaging systems, managing the logistics, and the time-consuming nature of the process. Through our innovative solutions, we are cutting down from days to seconds the time it takes to receive a valuation; and from weeks to hours, the time necessary to sell! Verado is changing the rules of the game - It’s simplicity, re-engineered. We believe selling should be as seamless as buying. Therefore, rather than accumulating unused products at home or worse letting them end up in a landfill forever -  we enable individuals to monetize their unwanted things, free up valuable space in their home and reduce their need for borrowing whilst simultaneously minimizing their ecological footprint.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Internet Services, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Claudio de Giovanni, Mirko de Giovanni",1-10,3,Seed,2019-05-31,110500,GBP,139661,Pre-Seed,110500,GBP,139661,Pre-Seed,239500,GBP,302098,463635,USD,463635,"Banco BPM, Verado Capital, Fin Posillipo Spa, Mirko de Giovanni, White Hope Holding",3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,0,0,,1,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments

Direct Auctions: In this auctions the users place bids on the products they want to buy. Each auction has a countdown starting at 5.00 when the counter reaches 0.00 the last user to bid wins the auction and the product. But, if any user bids when the time left is 15 seconds or less the time increases by 15 more seconds allowing more users to participate.  This kind of auction is very different from eBay, because in eBay the user that pays the most is the one who wins the auction. In Bidoo the winner is the last one to bid. 2. Reverse Auctions: In this auctions the user places a bid for one amount, for example 1,22$ if that amount is the lowest and unique at the end of the auction that user wins. If there are more bids for the same amount or another bid lower and unique is that user the one who wins.",,,,,,,,,,,,Commerce and Shopping,,,11-50,1,Seed,2018-11-05,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,iStarter,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2.3,,,,
