This late detection leads to higher intervention costs, greater emotional distress for children, and increased strain on teachers and families. DINO is revolutionizing the way we approach early learning disorder identification by leveraging AI, gamification, and data-driven insights to create a scalable, efficient, and engaging solution for schools. Our mission is simple: ensure that every child, regardless of background or geography, has access to early and accurate learning disorder detection. By intervening at the right time, we empower schools, educators, and families to provide the best possible support for students who need it most. A Disruptive Approach to Educational Assessment Traditional methods of identifying learning difficulties are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and dependent on expert evaluations that may not be readily available. DINO changes this paradigm by offering: AI-powered early detection – Our intelligent algorithms analyze gameplay data to identify potential learning challenges in real time. Gamified assessment – Students engage in fun, interactive activities that collect meaningful cognitive and linguistic data without creating stress or pressure. Minimal teacher intervention – The tool is designed for independent use, allowing educators to focus on classroom instruction while gathering valuable insights. Scalability and cost-efficiency – Unlike traditional assessment methods, DINO can be deployed in multiple schools with minimal logistical constraints. Proven Business Model & Strong Market Validation DINO’s business model has been successfully implemented in Italy, demonstrating strong financial sustainability and market demand. Our approach is based on: A subscription-based pricing model: Schools pay a setup fee (€200 per institution) and an annual fee per student (€10 per child), ensuring affordability while maintaining profitability. High margins and low operational costs: Delivery costs are minimal (€1 per report, totaling €2 per child annually), allowing for flexible pricing adaptation, with an average deal size of €1,350 per school.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Health Care, Software",3,"Francesco Garosci, Francesco Trovato, Giacomo Pratesi",1-10,3,Seed,2024-12-31,112500,EUR,116437,Grant,338000,EUR,349833,Seed,475000,EUR,485272,587500,EUR,601709,"PLAI Accelerator, Compagnia di San Paolo, European funds, VITA Accelerator, Regione Piemonte",2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,-0.1,8,,,,

Founded in 2015, it aims to contribute to the construction of a safer and more sustainable Food system. Wenda is the only all-in-one collaborative Platform to govern Food traceability data from the cold and hot chain. Wenda is a collaborative Platform that automatically collects, analyzes and shares supply chain data, automatically integrating with existing measurement tools, data loggers and management, logistics and quality software available on the market and already in use in the customer company. In this way it provides decision support and statistics on temperature and traceability to each player in each specific supply chain. Wenda’s multi-disciplinary team has a long experience in technology, in the management of corporate clients and in agile innovation methods (IoT solutions). It has developed key partnerships with Universities and leading European companies. Wenda mission is to contribute to the reduction of the Food waste by leveraging on the power of digitalization of the Food supply chain. At the same time, the company aims to contribute to the development of safety and traceability in the food system. Wenda developed an user-friendly, ease-to use and versatile Platform which automatically collects, controls, manages and shares food distribution supply chain data, integrating with measurement tools, data loggers and software (management, logistics and quality). The Platform responds to the food distribution companies needs for reduction of time and costs for the optimization of their processes and necessity of control of risk points. Wenda products can be widespread at a global level. The innovativeness of its technology, international vocation and its scalable business model make its solution the best one in allowing to effectively pursue its mission. Below is a list of the different features of the Platform. -Data management and integrity analytics: You can gain visibility into traceability and temperature data by controlling the main risk points in the supply chain. With the simple and easy-to-use all-in- one Platform, you can enhance your decision making and service level, cutting costs, optimizing time and increasing profits. -Document digitization and data storage: you can import the documents of each shipment, storage or goods entry, reducing storage time, quickly retrieving information and documents, receiving alerts and operational actions, sharing data with employees. All this from a single integrated and easy to use Platform. -Universal IoT Platform: The full potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be exploited to integrate all data loggers and measuring instruments already in use in the customer company or available on the market and to make them communicate with each other. In this way you can save time and ensure continuity with the technologies already in use, welcoming future developments. -Horizontal process management: You can increase your supply chain collaboration by working across the company and strengthening your connection with customers and suppliers. Thanks to multi-site management and multi-access control, you can choose with whom to share data in real time, allowing access to logistics, quality and management departments. This data can also be shared directly with suppliers and customers. -Blockchain, Big Data and Machine learning: the use of blockchain has three major benefits: transparency (everyone can visualize the information recorded on the blockchain), decentralization (blockchain operates on a network), security (data and transactions on the blockchain are encrypted). All the data gathered in the Platform form a huge quantity of data (Big Data): this improve the quality of decisions operators can make on the basis of that data, An additional help comes from the Machine Learning algorithm integrated in the Platform: the machine “learns” the best and most efficient way to manage processes and builds more and more refined models which can help operators in making decisions. A key goal of the Platform is to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. This is why the Platform is organized into modules, allowing the customer to choose the ones needed for operations: taken individually, the modules manage temperature and heat and cold chain traceability in well-defined supply chain processes; when used in combination, the modules provide full end-to-end visibility of supply chain processes, supporting key players in making effective decisions, rationalizing costs, increasing profits and enhancing service levels. Below is a review of the different modules of the Platform: Shipping Phase - SHIPMENT Module Control, manage and share cold and heat chain data and traceability of products shipped in direct or split trucks, full containers (FCL) or groupage (LCL). Share information with customers and employees through the Shipment Module. -Control and management from web app -Verification of the condition of goods in transit -Logistic performance control -Savings from delivery optimization -Integrated data loggers: real-time datalogger / USB datalogger, Sea freight, Ground freight, Air freight, location, temperature, humidity and other sensors Storage phase - STORAGE Module Control, manage and share temperature data and traceability of old generation cold rooms, refrigerated display cabinets, manholes or refrigerators or already controlled with telemetry, and provide information to employees with the Storage Module. -Control and management from web app and mobile app -Digitizing the control of stored products -Verification of refrigeration systems -Save time on HACCP checks and reports -Integrated data loggers: wi-fi real-time data loggers / Bluetooth probes or data loggers / other instruments already in use in the company Reception stage - INBOUND Module Verify the product for which you will be responsible by checking, managing and sharing the temperature data and HACCP checklists detected during the goods entry.
